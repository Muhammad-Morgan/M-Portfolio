## Muhammad Morgan – Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio built with Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It showcases the work I care about most: high-quality front-end builds, animation-friendly interfaces, and tooling that improves the developer experience.

### Highlights
- **Hero experience** inspired by mwjb.net: live particle background, cinematic gradients, and a sticky navbar for quick navigation.
- **Tech & Projects sections** that share the same starry background, with refined gradient overlays for each new piece of work.
- **Responsive layout** tuned for desktop-first clarity, but fluid enough to stretch across tablets and phones.

### Stack
- Next.js App Router / React 19
- TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI primitives for controls and typography
- Lucide icons and custom SVGs for hero art

Feel free to use this layout as inspiration or reach out for collaboration.
